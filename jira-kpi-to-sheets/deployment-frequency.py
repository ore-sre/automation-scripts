"""
This script calculates deployment frequency KPIs from Jira issues and updates a Google Sheet for reporting.

Main tasks:
- Connects to Jira to fetch issue data related to deployments.
- Calculates deployment frequency metrics over a specified period.
- Updates a Google Sheet ("Production Reliability Workbook" > "Deployment Frequency") with the calculated KPIs.

Environment variables required:
- JIRA_API_TOKEN: Jira API token for authentication.
- JIRA_EMAIL: Jira user email for authentication.
- GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS (optional): Path to Google service account credentials.

Dependencies:
- requests
- python-dotenv
- gspread
